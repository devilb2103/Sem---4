    "<p>You are hired as an AI expert in the development department of a telecommunications company. The first thing on your orientation plan is a small project that your boss has assigned you for the following given situation. Your supervisor has given away his private cell phone number on too many websites and is now complaining about daily spam SMS. Therefore, it is your job to write a spam detector in Python. </p>\n",

For the evaluation of your spam detector, an SMS collection is available as a dataset - this has yet to be suitably split into train and test data. To keep the costs as low as possible and to avoid problems with copyrights, your boss insists on a new development with Python.</p>\n",
