You can use existing libraries but the training needs to be done from scratch (usage of pretrained weights is not allowed). You have the freedom to select any dataset for training the model. Use a small subset of data as a validation dataset and report the BLEU score on the validation set. Also, provide a short description of your transformer model architecture, hyperparameters, and training (also provide the training loss curve)."
