# Java Console Calculator

This is a simple Java console-based calculator program with two parts:

## Part 1: Factorial Calculator

Calculates the factorial of a number using various input methods:

1. **Command Line Args**: Calculates factorial using the provided command line argument.
2. **Scanner**: Takes user input using the Scanner class to calculate the factorial.
3. **BufferedReader**: Uses BufferedReader to read user input and calculates the factorial.
4. **DataInputStream**: Calculates factorial using DataInputStream to read user input.
5. **Console**: Utilizes the Console class to take user input and calculate the factorial.

## Part 2: Basic Calculator Operations

Performs various basic calculator operations:

1. **Addition**: Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
2. **Subtraction**: Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the subtraction.
3. **Multiplication**: Takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
4. **Division**: Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the division.
5. **Square Root**: Takes one number as input and returns its square root.
6. **Power**: Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second.
7. **Mean**: Takes multiple numbers as input until the user enters "end" and returns their mean.
8. **Variance**: Takes the number of inputs, then takes multiple numbers as input and returns the variance.

## Code Structure

- **MainClass.java**: Contains the main menu and the logic to switch between Part 1 and Part 2.
- **InputClass.java**: Handles user input methods, including Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, and Console.
- **Calc.java**: Implements the basic calculator operations and factorial calculation.
